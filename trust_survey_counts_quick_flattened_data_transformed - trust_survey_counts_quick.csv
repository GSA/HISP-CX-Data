The Net Promoter Score (NPS) also improved by 5.4 points over the same time period in 2020. The NPS revealed that visitors who visit once a month were more satisfied than those who visit multiple times per week; which is indicative of those seeking reservations at high-demand locations with limited availability. In fact, lack of availability is the primary reason for visitor task failures for the past two quarters, according to the CSAT survey. The increased demand for recreation opportunities is decreasing the availability for reservable inventory on Recreation.gov, which is frustrating for visitors. The recommendation feature is a tool to help visitors find nearby locations that are available when the sites they originally selected are not. The team also focused on the needs of new users.

Fortunately, TBCC Call Technicians and Agency staff were able to maintain beneficiary satisfaction by continuing to manage beneficiary expectations and providing callers with realistic timeframes for account updates and disbursements. Unexpectedly, for the Satisfaction, Trust, Ease and Efficiency A-11 Required Questions, the """"Strongly Disagree"""" response scores were higher than anticipated. These scores may be partially due to the pandemic telework solution and temporary call management queue, that is being used for responding to incoming beneficiary inquiries, which requires that the caller wait for a long period of time before their call is answered.

Therefore, the daily customer satisfaction surveys were suspended. Although there are many reasons for temporarily halting the surveys, the primary reasons are: a.) the current process for accessing the TBCC may not be considered easy or convenient for the beneficiary and b.) BTFA did not want to burden the beneficiaries with responding to a survey during this pandemic, especially with many Indian reservations experiencing lock-downs,. Unfortunately, the telework solution for responding to incoming beneficiary inquiries did not include the ability to capture performance metrics such as: speed to answer, call handle time and abandoned rate. Therfore, the performance metrics reported under Operational Metrics do not reflect actual performance for Q1.

This analysis will help us identify potential policy changes and reform. Another CX deliverable is to develop a mobile-accessible, online process so that any individual applying for or receiving Social Security services can upload forms, documentation, evidence, or correspondence associated with their transaction without the need for service-specific tools or traveling to a field office.

Customer satisfaction with employee helpfulness remained FEMA's top performing area. The area that needs the most improvement continues to be addressing customer needs. This e-mail only customer satisfaction survey has now been utilized for three quarters (since FY21 Q4). In this quarter, satisfaction across all questions decreased, returning to rates similar to fourth quarter of FY 2021. This may be due to the mix of disasters surveyed also returning to mostly severe storms, tornadoes, and flooding events, which accounted for 67% of the survey responses. This is unlike last quarter, where 89% of the survey responses were related to hurricane events. FEMA has been working to supplement quantitative data from surveys like this one with qualitative data to provide a more holistic picture of the survivor experience. For example, a project to revise our outbound letters that we send to disaster survivors, as well as an effort underway to reimagine how survivors experience direct housing are both leveraging survivor focus groups to inform changes to how we deliver services to survivors.

The number of survey responses for OPM’s Services Online decreased by 40.43 percent in FY 2022 Q3 as compared to Q2. This decrease is primarily due to a reduced need for customers to access the site for tax information. Between Q2 and Q3, all seven scores decreased, on average, by 0.45: satisfaction (4.36 to 3.95), trust (4.28 to 3.89), effectiveness (4.34 to 3.97), ease (4.28 to 3.64), efficiency (4.26 to 3.79), equity (4.45 to 4.02) and website helpfulness (4.3 to 3.87). OPM attributes these decreases to a significant technical change made to how users access Services Online. In FY 2022 Q3, RS added multi-factor authentication via GSA’s Login.gov to the account login process. This change requires that the customer establish a Login.gov account and link it to their Services Online account. Once the accounts are linked, customers benefit from improved online account security; the ability to use an email address for the login name, instead of a claim number; and streamlined online password reset.

Notable for Q4, question 6 (easiliy understood the response) for the phone channel was down 16% (3.7) vs. Q3 (4.4) and the average of Q1-Q3 (4.4). The number of ""1"" responses for question 6 (1,065) were nearly doubled the number for each of the previous three quarters (503, 514, 586). In contrast, the participation volume (7,257) was lower (by 1,000-5,000) than each of the previous three quarters. This feedback will be shared with the TCC leadership. During Q1, we reviewed the survey process for each channel in order to identify any potential issues. The following changes were implemented based on that review: 1) increased email survey invitation rate from 25% to 100%, 2) added QA measures to the email survey process to validate outgoing invites, 3) moved phone survey opt-in checkpoint from pre-call to post-call. These changes have increased survey participation during the last 2 quarters (email up 15%; phone up 3-8%). We are continuing to work closely (continual, daily oversight/ support) with our new TSA Contact Center (TCC) vendor, as we work in partnership to bring their operation to a mature state that meets their service level agreements on a routine basis. Their pain points remain staffing from both an overall perspective (enough to meet the demand), as well as a quality perspective (seasoned, knowledgeable). Note: We have no phone survey data to report for 07/01/22 through 07/13/22 due to server outages that started during the previous quarter (noted on the Q3 summary). In addition, we have no phone survey data to report for 09/14/22 through 09/30/22 due to user error (accidental deletion by contractor).",50232,50232,7257,6970,2,This interaction increased my confidence in TSA,359,205,558,896,4952,5848,4.42,trust

While most survey results were very similar to the previous quarter, this area’s rating decreased from 75% last quarter to 67% this quarter. The decrease was in part influenced by the two Hurricane Ian DRs in Florida, 4673-FL and 4675-FL, which contributed about a quarter of the responses and reported lower satisfaction across all questions. In the aftermath of Hurricane Ian, FEMA worked with more than 950,000 individuals and families to register for FEMA assistance. This large influx of registrations had a sizable impact on our call center hold times which likely contributed to decreased satisfaction showed by our survey results. One of FEMA's standing goals is to meet survivors where they are in our programs, outreach, and communications. As part of an effort to better communicate with survivors, FEMA rolled out revised correspondence to survivors beginning with DR-4677-SC in November 2022.

In 2020, VBA guaranteed 1.2 million home loans and provided Post-9/11 GI Bill payments to over 600,000 beneficiaries.",26,Contacting the Benefits Administration contact center,VBA Education Applying for Benefits,CX data is collected using an online transactional survey disseminated three times a week within 2-5 days after callers have interacted with the call center.,email,TRUE,"EDU’s review of 1st quarter data identified: * Ease/Simplicity and Efficiency/Speed continue to score at the highest of all domains; however, Confidence/Trust has grown to one of the highest domains as well. * The majority of respondents indicated the tools VA makes available to them to make education and training decisions was not applicable in their decision to apply for benefits. This is a pain point because EDU's Confidence/Trust score depends on the response to this question. However, it's not apparent whether or not respondents were aware of the tools, or the tools simply were not useful. * Equity/Transparency is the lowest score domain in each survey, except for Touchpoint 3 (""Receiving Benefits"") in which Satisfaction is the lowest score. Moments That Matter to Veterans: * Satisfaction improved for each survey. Confidence/Trust scores also improved, but not as significantly across all surveys. Future initiatives: * EDU continues to re-engineer the current VSignals surveys, in which we expect response rates will increase. * EDU expects Equity/Transparency scores to increase as VBA implements the Digital GI Bill Initiatives. OAR’s review of 1st quarter data identified: * Customer/Veteran satisfaction remains higher for Higher-Level Review (HLR) claimants participating in an informal conference. Fifty-one percent of HLR survey respondents reported participating in an informal conference. Sentiment and average scores are similar at the two Decision Review Operation Centers. •The first survey question (""Please indicate how you filed your decision review request"") does not have an option to report the claim was filed online. The only options are by mail or fax, dropped it off at a VA Regional Office, or my private attorney or Veteran Service Officer filed it for me. Claimants that filed online feel excluded or overlooked. Two Insights from Moments That Matter to Veterans: * Satisfaction with the HLR process is influenced by the decision review outcome. Comparison of cases where all issues were granted to cases where all issues were denied shows a significant positive sentiment trend for those cases where all issues were granted. This impacts satisfaction significantly as the grant rate is and will remain low. The dashboard only included decision review results for 8.8% of the Q1 cases. This data is populated from a CaseFlow-generated table within Enterprise Data Warehouse that historically has failed to provide adequate data. Claimants want to be part of the claim process and prefer to have the status of their claim communicated throughout the process. Filing a claim, waiting/not understanding what or if something is happening, and then receiving the decision by mail is perceived by the claimant as impersonal and exclusionary. * Claimants would like an advocate within VBA to aid with lane choice (i.e., someone who can recommend the best lane and strategy for their individual situation). Service Recovery (SR)/Process Improvement (PI) respondents report the necessity for third-party assistance to choose a lane and file the appropriate claim.
